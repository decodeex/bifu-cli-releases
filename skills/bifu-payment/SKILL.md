# bifu-cli: payment & funds

Activate for balances, moving funds between accounts, and listing forex accounts.
Requires a logged-in profile (see bifu-auth).

## Balances

```bash
bifu-cli payment balance                 # fiat saving balance
bifu-cli payment balance --currency USD
bifu-cli payment balance --total         # aggregated total across accounts
```

## Transfers

```bash
# Unified transfer between accounts (e.g. saving <-> spot/contract/forex)
bifu-cli payment unified-transfer --help    # show exact flags for from/to/currency/amount
```

## Forex accounts

```bash
bifu-cli payment forex-accounts          # list the user's MT5/TradFi accounts + login ids
```

## Notes
- Output is right-aligned and totaled in table mode; use `--json` for scripting.
- Transfers move real funds — review amounts; pass `-y/--yes` only when certain.
