# bifu-cli: private & forex push streams

Activate to stream the user's own trading events (orders/fills/positions) and
forex push-gateway quotes. Requires a logged-in profile (bifu-auth). For public
market data, use bifu-market-stream.

```bash
bifu-cli ws private          # contract private trading events
bifu-cli ws private --spot   # spot private trading events
bifu-cli ws pushgw           # MT5 push-gateway forex quotes
```

## Endpoints

```bash
bifu-cli ws config show
bifu-cli ws config set --private-url wss://contract.bifu.dev/api/v1/private/contract/ws
```

## Notes
- The private streams send the session cookie automatically from the active profile.
- Runs until Ctrl-C; `-o json` for raw frames.
